## Features

- **Multiple Tables**: The application supports up to 20 different tables or workspaces, each with its own timer.

- **Task Tracking**: The application displays the elapsed time for each task, allowing users to monitor progress.
- **Dynamic UI**: The UI dynamically updates to reflect the status of each timer.

## Usage

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. The application will load, displaying multiple tables labeled "Masa 1" through "Masa 20".
4. Each table has a "Start" button for initiating the timer for a task.
5. Clicking the "Start" button will start the timer, which will display the elapsed time.
6. Clicking the "Finish" button (which replaces the "Start" button) will stop the timer and display the total time elapsed.
7. After stopping the timer, the application will calculate the "Borcunuz" (debt) based on the time elapsed and display it in Turkish Lira (TL).
